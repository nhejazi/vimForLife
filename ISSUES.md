## _Known Problem(s)_

- There is a known issue with re-mapping `Ctrl-H` in Neovim's terminal mode. I
  have only encountered this issue when running macOS; various workarounds have
  been proposed [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/2048).
  (__update:__ This issue has been resolved as of 15 May 2016.)
