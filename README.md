# My Neovim Configuration

> Setup, package manager, and various plugins for my configuration of the
> [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) editor.

_Caveat emptor_ - using this configuration can be unintuitive at first (esp. to
those new to Vim), see the directions below.

## _**Directions/Guide**_

For less terse directions, see [this ~~excellent~~ decent
post](https://jacky.wtf/weblog/moving-to-neovim/), on which this guide is
partially based. Note that this assumes familiarity with Vim.

+ To obtain the configuration in this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nhejazi/myneovimconfig.git ~/.config/nvim
sh ~/.config/nvim/_setup.sh
```

+ To install plugins with the [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
manager:
```vim
:PlugInstall
```
